# Knowledge Graph + Graph Neural Network + Generative Adversarial Network

This work aims to produce enriched semantic embedding by the GNN-based model 
learned from a knowledge graph for each action class. 
Then the produced semantic embedding can be considered as input to the GAN-based framework to generate
visual features of unseen classes to achieve the ZSL and GZSL tasks in the field of human action recognition.
